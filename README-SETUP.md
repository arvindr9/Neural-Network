###Screenshots of the output of the program can be found in the screenshots folder
####Please refer to README-INFO.md for information about program and methodology

####Mac

* Python 2.7 is needed, and is installed by default
* Tensorflow is required. Installation instructions can be found at https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup
* Numpy is also required. Installation instructions can be found at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/install.html

####Windows
* Warning: Installation is more complicated for Windows than it is for Mac
* Python 2.7 is needed, but is not normally installed by default. Installation instructions can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
* Tensorflow is required. Installation instructions can be found at https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup

###Running the Program
####Mac
1. Download the repository from the green download button
2. Open Terminal
3. Enter the following:
```
cd (file directory)
```
Or drag the folder into the Terminal window after entering `cd` and then press enter

Then, enter the following and then press enter:

```
python NN.py
```
There will be a time delay until text appears on the screen because of the program embedding both 5000 word long input files. AFter that, the neural network portion of the program will start. after, the accuracy will be displayed and an input will requested.

####Windows
1. Download the repository from the green download button
3. Open the folder, which is contained in Downloads, containing the file
2. Open Command Prompt
3. Enter the following:
```
C:\Python27\python.exe 
```
Then drag the file into command prompt and press enter. If it does not work, add a space in between the above code and dragging in the file.

There will be a time delay until text appears on the screen because of the program embedding both 5000 word long input files. AFter that, the neural network portion of the program will start. After, the accuracy will be displayed and an input will requested.
